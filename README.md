Apply ML in Real Estate Price Analysis & Prediction

Overview

This project explores how Machine Learning (ML) can be applied to analyze and predict real estate prices. Using a dataset of real estate listings, we apply various ML techniques to extract insights, find trends, and build predictive models.

Features

 Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing real estate data for analysis
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing price distributions and key factors
 Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features for better predictions
 Machine Learning Models: Applying and evaluating models such as:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Neural Networks Prediction & Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ²
